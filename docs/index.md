*"valid8ing is not a crime" ;-)*

`valid8` provides user-friendly tools for 

 * general-purpose inline validation, 
 * function inputs/outputs validation 
 * class fields validation. 
 
All entry points raise consistent `ValidationError` including all contextual details, with dynamic inheritance of `ValueError`/`TypeError` as appropriate.

!!! warning "Name changes in version 3.x"
    In version 3.x several name changes were introduced to improve readability. The old names will stay valid until version 4.x, except for `@validate` that is discontinued starting in 3.2 (renamed `@validate_io`).


## Do I need a validation library ?

Type and Value Validation in python is not straightforward. However it is key to smooth user experience for all of our libraries and applications. Good validation leads to less user frustration, but should not be at the cost of the developer's overall efficiency.

I searched and found tons of good and less good libraries [out there](#other-validation-libraries), but did not find any that would provide a somehow generic answer covering 80% of the needs - especially the particular needs I had for class attributes validation in [autoclass](https://smarie.github.io/python-autoclass/). I therefore propose this library to the open source community, at least to create a reference and maybe one day reach a satisfying solution for a significant amount of developers.

In [this page](./why_validation), we explain what is validation, what you would need to do in order to implement it correctly (`assert` is not a viable solution), and demonstrate how much effort that would cost you. This high development cost results in validation being done inconsistently, if not skipped totally, in many applications and libraries.

`valid8` provides tools to perform validation in a minimum number of lines and with built-in consistency, so that it hopefully becomes fun and easy to include in your code. 


## Installing

```bash
> pip install valid8
```

Optional but recommended:

 - If you wish to create highly compact object classes with field type+value validation, have a look at [autoclass](https://smarie.github.io/python-autoclass/) which is where `valid8` actually originates from. See usage [here](./valid8_with_other).

 - If you wish to define your own validation functions dynamically for functions and classes validation, you may wish to also install [mini_lambda](https://smarie.github.io/python-mini-lambda/). See below for details.


## Usage - inline validation

`valid8` provides two validation methods that you may use anywhere in your code: 

 * `validate(...)` to perform the most simple validation tasks in one line of code
 * `with validation(...)` (or its alias `with validator(...) as v`) for any other validation task, in two or more lines of code


### (a) `validate`

The `validate` method is the most straightforward, but less flexible, tool in this toolbox. It provides you with ways to quickly validate one or several of:

 * value is not `None`
 * value is an **instance** of one type in a reference set, or is a **subtype** of a reference set
 * value **equals** a reference item, 
 * value is **contained** in a set, **contains** a reference item, or is a **sub/superset** of a reference set 
 * value is **greater/smaller** than a reference (strict or not)
 * value **length** is fixed, or is **greater/smaller** than a reference (strict or not).

In case of failure, it raises the same kind of `ValidationError` objects than more elaborate validation methods provided below, so it is consistent with the rest of `valid8`. Besides, the exception `__cause__` is the same than the equivalent operators from the [valid8 base validation library](./base_validation_lib).
 
For example:

```python
from valid8 import validate

surf = -1

validate('surface', surf, instance_of=int, min_value=0)
```

results in

```bash
ValidationError[ValueError]: Error validating [surface=-1]. \
   TooSmall: x >= 0 does not hold for x=-1. Wrong value: [-1].
```

Note that the resulting exception object contains much of the available information (`var_name`, `var_value`, `validation_outcome`) as fields.

See `help(validate)` for usage details.


### (b) `validator`/`validation`

The `validator` (alias `validation`) context manager is a bit more flexible than `validate`: it allows you to define the validation procedure yourself, with any statement or function of your choice.

If you rely on **functions that output a boolean flag indicating success**, you simply have to plug that flag on the object provided by the context manager, as shown below:

```python
from valid8 import validator

surf = -1

with validator('surface', surf) as v:
    v.alid = surf > 0 and isfinite(surf)
```

Which yields

```bash
ValidationError[ValueError]: Error validating [surface=-1]:  \
   validation function [v.alid = surf > 0 and isfinite(surf)] returned [False].
```

Note that the text of the error displays the source code that led to that failure. 


If you rely on **functions that may raise exceptions**, `validator` will catch them and append them as the `__cause__` of the resulting `ValidationError`: 

```python
from valid8 import validator

surf = 1j

with validator('surface', surf) as v:
    v.alid = surf > 0 and isfinite(surf)
```

yields

```bash
ValidationError[TypeError]: Error validating [surface=1j]. \
   Validation function [v.alid = surf > 0 and isfinite(surf)] raised \
       TypeError: '>' not supported between instances of 'complex' and 'int'.
```


With `validator` you are therefore **guaranteed** that any exception happening in the validation process will be caught and turned into a friendly `ValidationError`, whatever the cause (`None` handling, known validation failures, unknown other errors). You therefore do not have to write the usual [if/else/try/except wrappers](./why_validation#explicit-traditional-way) to handle all cases.


A couple important things to note:

 * the field name where you put the boolean flag does not matter, so if you prefer you can use alternate naming such as `with validator(...) as r:` and then `r.esults = `
 * there is no need to feed any result to the validator. If you rely on *failure raiser*-style base functions, for example a `check_uniform_sampling` or a `assert_series_equal`, you can just call them and the wrapper will assume that no exception means success. In such case the `validation` alias might make more sense in terms of readability:
 
```python
with validation('dataframe', df, instance_of=pd.DataFrame):
    check_uniform_sampling(df)
    assert_series_equal(df['a'], ref_series)
```

**Note on type checking with `isinstance`"**
Although you *can* use the built-in `isinstance` method inside your validation code block, if you do it `valid8` will not be able to distinguish between `TypeError` and `ValueError`. Instead, please consider either 

 * using the `instance_of` parameter of `validation`:

```python
with validator('surface', surf, instance_of=int) as v:
    v.alid = surf > 0
```
    
 * or using the provided `assert_instance_of` method:
    
```python
from valid8 import assert_instanceof

with validator('surface', surf) as v:
    assert_instance_of(surf, int)
    v.alid = surf > 0
```



## Customizing the `ValidationException`

Various options are provided to customize the raised exception. These options are available both on `validate`, `validator`/`validation`, and even on valid8 function and class decorators that we'll see below (`@validate_arg`, `@validate_field`...). 

### (a) custom message

You can specify a custom error message that will be displayed at the beginning of the default message:

```python
with validation('surface', surf, 
                help_msg="Surface should be a finite positive integer") as v:
    v.alid = surf > 0 and isfinite(surf)
```

yields for `surf = -1`

```bash
ValidationError[ValueError]: Surface should be a finite positive integer. \
    Error validating [surface=-1]: \
    validation function [v.alid = surf > 0 and isfinite(surf)] returned [False].
```

### (b) custom type

Or even better, a custom error type, which is a good practice to ease internationalization (unique applicative error codes). The base `ValidationError` class provides default behaviours allowing you to define subclasses in a quite compact form:

```python
class InvalidSurface(ValidationError):
    help_msg = 'Surface should be a positive integer'

validate('surface', surf, instance_of=int, min_value=0, 
            error_type=InvalidSurface)
``` 

yields for `surf = -1`

```bash
InvalidSurface[ValueError]: Surface should be a positive integer. \
   Error validating [surface=-1]. \
   TooSmall: x >= 0 does not hold for x=-1. Wrong value: [-1].
```

### (c) message templating

Finally, the `help_msg` field acts as a string template that will receive any additional keyword argument thrown at the validation method. So you can define reusable error classes without too much hassle:

```python
class InvalidSurface(ValidationError):
    help_msg = 'Surface should be > {minimum}, found {var_value}'

validate('surface', surf, instance_of=int, min_value=0, 
            error_type=InvalidSurface, minimum=0)
```

yields

```bash
InvalidSurface[ValueError]: Surface should be > 0, found -1. \
   Error validating [surface=-1]. \
   TooSmall: x >= 0 does not hold for x=-1. Wrong value: [-1].
```

Note: as shown in that last example, the value being validated is already sent to the help message string to format under the `'var_value'` key, so you do not need to pass it. 

Obviously you can further customize your exception subclasses if you wish.


### (d) `TypeError` or `ValueError`

`ValidationError` does not by default inherit from `TypeError` or `ValueError`, because in the general case, `valid8` has no means of knowing. But you may have noticed in all of the output message examples shown above that one of the two is still appearing each time in the resulting exception. This is because `valid8` automatically guesses: when a validation error happens, it recursively looks at the type of the failure cause for a `TypeError` or `ValueError` (default if nothing is found). It then **dynamically** creates an appropriate exception type inheriting both from `ValidationError` and from either `TypeError` or `ValueError` according to what has been found. This dynamic type has some custom display methods that make it appear as follows:

```bash
> validate('surface', -1, instance_of=int, min_value=0)
ValidationError[ValueError]

> validate('surface', 1j, instance_of=int, min_value=0)
ValidationError[TypeError]
```

If you do not wish the automatic guessing to happen, you can always declare the inheritance explicitly by creating custom subclasses inheriting from the one of your choice, or both:

```python
class InvalidSurface(ValidationError, TypeError, ValueError):
    help_msg = ""
```

If you create a custom subclass but do not inherit from `TypeError` nor `ValueError`, the automatic guessing will take place as usual.


## Validating functions & classes

In order to use the decorators presented in this section, you will have to provide them with a **base validation function** - as opposed to `validate` where it was just a bunch of options, and `validation`/`validator` where you could basically write any validation code inside the context manager.

The requirements for accepted base validation functions are extremely simple: any single-input function returning `True` or `None` in case of success is [accepted](./accepted). In order for you to get started quickly, you can even leverage the following existing tools:

 * the bundled [validation functions library](./base_validation_lib).
 * the [`mini_lambda`](https://smarie.github.io/python-mini-lambda/) syntax to define some validation functions inline (such as `x > 0`) without writing `lambda x:`. 
 * the bundled [composition functions](./composition)


### (a) functions

The `@validate_arg` decorator adds input validation to a function. Here is an example where we decorate a `build_house` function:

```python
from mini_lambda import s, Len
from valid8 import validate_arg, instance_of

@validate_arg('name', instance_of(str), Len(s) > 0, 
              help_msg='name should be a non-empty string')
def build_house(name, surface=None):
    print('Building house... DONE !')
    return name, surface
```

As you can see above, any number of base validation functions can be provided to the decorator - this will correspond to an implicit `and_` being performed, equivalent to one that you would have done with the [composition framework](./composition). Here we validate the input argument `name` by chaining the function `instance_of(str)` (from the built-in [validation functions library](./base_validation_lib)) with a custom lambda function `Len(s) > 0` created using the [`mini_lambda`](https://smarie.github.io/python-mini-lambda/) syntax. An implicit `and_` is done between the two.

Let's try it:

```bash
> build_house('sweet home', 200)    # Valid

> build_house('', 200)
InputValidationError[ValueError]: name should be a non-empty string. \
   Error validating input [name=] for function [build_house]. \
   Validation function [and(instance_of_<class 'str'>, len(s) > 0)] raised \
   AtLeastOneFailed: \
     At least one validation function failed validation for value []. \
     Successes: ["instance_of_<class 'str'>"] / Failures: {'len(s) > 0': 'False'}.
```

We can see in this verbose exception all details of interest: first the custom `help_msg`; then the validated function and input name; and finally the composition failure resulting from one of the two base functions failing (`len(s) > 0` as stated). *Note that since `Len` is `mini_lambda`'s equivalent of `len`, the string representation is lowercase*

The `@validate_out` function decorator works the same way for output validation, except that you don't provide it with any name. 

Here is a more complete example with both input and output validation:

```python
from mini_lambda import s, x, l, Len
from valid8 import validate_arg, validate_out, instance_of, is_multiple_of

@validate_arg('name', instance_of(str), Len(s) > 0,
              help_msg='name should be a non-empty string')
@validate_arg('surface', (x >= 0) & (x < 10000), is_multiple_of(100),
              help_msg='Surface should be a multiple of 100 between 0 and 10000.')
@validate_out(instance_of(tuple), Len(l) == 2)
def build_house(name, surface=None):
    print('Building house... DONE !')
    return name, surface
```

Something strange happens:

```bash
> build_house(None)
InputValidationError[TypeError]: name should be a non-empty string. \
   Error validating input [name=None] ...
   
> build_house('sweet home')         # No error !
> build_house('sweet home', None)   # No error !
```

No error is raised when `surface` is `None`, while our base validation functions should both fail in presence of `None`:

```bash
> is_multiple_of(100)(None)   
TypeError: unsupported operand type(s) for %: 'NoneType' and 'int'

> (Len(s) > 0).evaluate(None)
TypeError: object of type 'NoneType' has no len()
```

Indeed, by default `None` values have a special treatment depending on the function signature: 

 * if the input to validate has a default value of `None`it is considered ***nonable***. For this input, `None` values will not enter the validation procedure and be sent directly to the function. In other words validation is skipped for `None`. The same principle goes for inputs and outputs that have a PEP484 `Optional[...]` type hint, with or without default value.
 * in the absence of `None` default value or `Optional[...]` type hint, the input or output is considered ***normal***. `None` values will be send to the validation function as usual, as it would be for non-`None` values

The default behaviour described above may not suit your needs, and can be changed by changing the `none_policy` keyword argument. Valid values are:

 * `NonePolicy.SKIP_IF_NONABLE_ELSE_VALIDATE`: the default behaviour described above
 * `NonePolicy.SKIP_IF_NONABLE_ELSE_FAIL`: same than the above, except that for ***normal*** inputs and outputs, `None` values will be rejected automatically - no need to test for `None` in your validation function.
 * `NonePolicy.SKIP`: validation will always be skipped for `None` values
 * `NonePolicy.FAIL`: validation will always fail for `None` values
 * `NonePolicy.VALIDATE`: validation will always be performed even for `None` values

Finally, the exception customization options described [earlier](#customizing-the-validationexception) apply. For example a custom `error_type` may be provided, except that the custom type should inherit from `InputValidationError` or `OutputValidationError`.


### (b) class fields

The `@validate_field` decorator adds field validation to a class. It is able to validate a field if the field is:

 * a [descriptor](https://docs.python.org/3.6/howto/descriptor.html#descriptor-example) - in which case it is equivalent to a `@validate_arg` added on the `__set__` function of the descriptor, but with a more user-friendly error message
 * a [property](https://docs.python.org/3.6/howto/descriptor.html#properties), in which case it is equivalent to a `@validate_arg` added on the `fset` function of the descriptor, but with a more user-friendly error message.
 * or a *constructor input*, in which case it is equivalent to a `@validate_arg` added on the constructor. In such case **WARNING** validation will only be called at initial object creation, not at subsequent field modifications!
 
Here is an example where we add validation to a `House` class with two fields:

```python
from valid8 import validate_field, instance_of, is_multiple_of
from mini_lambda import x, s, Len

@validate_field('name', instance_of(str), Len(s) > 0,
                help_msg='name should be a non-empty string')
@validate_field('surface', (x >= 0) & (x < 10000), is_multiple_of(100),
                help_msg='Surface should be a multiple of100 between 0 and 10000')
class House:
    def __init__(self, name, surface=None):
        self.name = name
        self.surface = surface

    @property
    def surface(self):
        return self.__surface

    @surface.setter
    def surface(self, surface=None):
        self.__surface = surface

```

Let's try it:

```bash
> h = House('sweet home')  # valid

> h = House('')
ClassFieldValidationError[ValueError]: name should be a non-empty string. \
   Error validating field [name=] for class [House]. \
   Validation function [and(instance_of_<class 'str'>, len(s) > 0)] raised \
   AtLeastOneFailed: \
      At least one validation function failed validation for value []. \
      Successes: ["instance_of_<class 'str'>"] / Failures: {'len(s) > 0': 'False'}

> h.surface = 10000
ClassFieldValidationError[ValueError]: Surface should be a multiple of 100 between 0 and 10000
   Error validating field [surface=10000] for class [House]. \
   Validation function [skip_on_none(and((x >= 0) & (x < 10000), \
                        is_multiple_of_100))] \
   raised AtLeastOneFailed: \
      At least one validation function failed validation for value [10000]. \
      Successes: ['is_multiple_of_100'] \
        / Failures: {'(x >= 0) & (x < 10000)': 'False'}.

> h.name = '' # WARNING: does not raise ValidationError (no setter!)
```

Once again, 

 * the default none policy is `SKIP_IF_NONABLE_ELSE_VALIDATE` but can be changed as we described in [previous section](#a-functions)
 * the exception customization options described [earlier](#customizing-the-validationexception) apply. For example a custom `error_type` may be provided, except that the custom type should inherit from `ClassFieldValidationError`.

### (c) testing goodies

It might be convient for you to be able to test your validation functions outside of a decorator. For this purpose you may wish to use the `assert_valid` function, which provides a similar signature, or the `Validator` object:

```bash
from mini_lambda import s, Len
from valid8 import assert_valid, Validator, instance_of

name = 'sweet_home'

# validate name with the same base validation functions we used earlier
assert_valid('name', name, instance_of(str), Len(s) > 0, 
             help_msg='name should be a non-empty string')

# same thing but in two steps
v = Validator(instance_of(str), Len(s) > 0, 
              help_msg='name should be a non-empty string')
v.assert_valid('name', name)
```
 

### (d) advanced composition

We saw that all tools described in this section perform an implicit `and_` between all the base validation functions provided in their positional arguments. There is a fast way to transform any of these individually into a *failure raiser* function, if it is more of a *boolean tester*: simply use a tuple `(<function>, <help_msg>)` and it will raise a `Failure` with the provided help message in case of failure. You can even use a tuple `(<function>, <exc_type>)` to provide a custom exception type, as long as it is a subclass of `Failure`.

This mechanism is a way to add details if you feel that your functions are not very self-explicit, for example if you make great use of lambda expressions that return a boolean flag.

For example:

```python
class InvalidSurface(ValidationError):
    help_msg = 'Surface should be a multiple of 100 between 0 and 10000'

v = Validator(((x >= 0) & (x < 10000), 'Surface should be between 0 and 10000'),
             (x % 100 == 0, 'Surface should be a multiple of 100'),
              error_type=InvalidSurface)
```

will raise the following two distinct error messages:

```bash
> v.assert_valid('surface', -100)
InvalidSurface[ValueError]: Surface should be a multiple of 100 between 0 and 10000. \
   Error validating [surface=-1]. \
   Validation function [and((x >= 0) & (x < 10000), x % 100 == 0)] raised \
   AtLeastOneFailed: \
      At least one validation function failed validation. \
      Successes: ['x % 100 == 0'] \
      / Failures: { \
        '(x >= 0) & (x < 10000)': \
            'WrappingFailure: Surface should be between 0 and 10000. \
            Function [(x >= 0) & (x < 10000)] returned [False] for value [-1].' 
      }.

> v.assert_valid('surface', 99)
InvalidSurface[ValueError]: Surface should be a multiple of 100 between 0 and 10000. \
   Error validating [surface=99]. \
   Validation function [and((x >= 0) & (x < 10000), x % 100 == 0)] raised \
   AtLeastOneFailed: \
      At least one validation function failed validation. \
      Successes: ['(x >= 0) & (x < 10000)'] \
      / Failures: {
         'x % 100 == 0': \
            'WrappingFailure: Surface should be a multiple of 100. \
            Function [x % 100 == 0] returned [False] for value [99].'
      }.
```


## Main features

 * **Separation of validation intent** (entry points `validate`, `validator`, `@validate_arg`...) **from validation means** (base validation code / functions). Entry points provide a clear and consistent behaviour matching your applicative intent, hiding the diversity of base validation functions that you rely on to do it.
 
 * Clear entry points to **serve most common needs** related with validation:
 
    - *Inline validation*: two functions `validate` and `validator`/`validation` to perform validation anywhere in your code.
    
    - *Function validation*: two decorators `@validate_arg` and `@validate_out`, as well as a more limited `@validate_io`, to add input and output validation to any function. A manual decorator `decorate_with_validation` provides the same functionality for retrofit purposes.
    
    - *Class validation*: one decorator `@validate_field` to add validation to class fields.
    
 * **Consistent behaviour**: all defensive mode entry points provide the same behaviour, raising subclasses of `ValidationError` in case of failure, whatever the diversity of failure modes that can happen in base validation code. The exception object contains all contextual information in its fields so as to be easily usable by a global exception handler at application-level, for example for internationalization. Moreover, the appropriate `TypeError` or `ValueError` base class is dynamically added to the resulting exception type. Consistency is also ensured by the fact that all entry points rely on a common `Validator` class.
 
 * **Highly customizable**: all entry points can be customized so as to fit your application needs. In particular you probably do not want users to see `valid8` exceptions and messages, but rather *your* exceptions and messages. This is easy to do with the two `help_msg` and `error_type` options.

 * **python-first, not schema-first**. This library is intended to provide validation anywhere in your code, not only when data enters a web service, a CLI or a form. There already are [libs out there](./other_libs#validation-of-data-at-the-entry-point) for that purpose. `valid8` is rather meant to be as simple as possible and as open as possible to any kind of validation, even those that can not easily be described in a schema.

 * **Separation of *value* validation from *type* validation is possible**. `valid8` can be [combined](./valid8_with_other#pep484-type-checkers) with any PEP484-based type validation library such as `enforce` or `pytypes`.

 * **Plays well with [autoclass](./valid8_with_other#autoclass) and [attrs](./valid8_with_other#attrs)**. Declare validation once by annotating the class with `@validate_field`, and you're good to go!

### decorator-specific
 
 * **Compliant with [most](./accepted) base validation functions out there**. You may use base validation functions from anywhere including your own, and including `functools.partial`, `lambda` or even callable objects implementing the `__call__` magic method. The *only* requirement is that they return `True` or `None` in case of success ! The way they fail is not important, `valid8` tolerates all. If you wish to create your own, you can leverage the three [exception classes](./accepted#built-in-exceptions) provided. 

 * **Built-in [library](./base_validation_lib) of base validation functions**, by object type. Do not hesitate to contribute! Also, do not hesitate to rely on other libraries for dedicated object types such as [these](./other_libs#domain-specific-validators-validators-for-specific-data-types-validators-without-framework), or to build your own !

 * **Built-in support for [mini_lambda](https://smarie.github.io/python-mini-lambda/)** to define base validation functions for the decorators, so that you do not need to write `lambda x:` everywhere, and the failure messages are far more easy to read. Besides the global error customization as well as **built-in syntax for [failure raiser definition](#d-advanced-composition)** allows you to easily add exception details to lambda expressions.
 
 * **Built-in composition framework**. Built-in functions `and_`, `or_`, `xor_`, `not_`, `not_all`, `failure_raiser`, `skip_on_none` and `fail_on_none` allow you to quickly create complex validation functions by reusing simpler ones, if you do not want to do it using `lambda` or `mini_lambda`. In particular, `and_` is implicitly used if you provide a list of base validation functions to any of the `valid8` decorators.
 

## Other Validation libraries

Many validation libraries are available on [PyPI](https://pypi.python.org/pypi?%3Aaction=search&term=valid&submit=search) already. The following [list](./other_libs) is by far not exhaustive, but gives an overview. Do not hesitate to contribute to this list with a pull request! 


## Origin of this project

When it all started, I was just looking for a library providing a `@validate` annotation with a basic library of validators and some logic to associate them, so as to complete [autoclass](https://smarie.github.io/python-autoclass/). I searched and found tons of good and less good libraries [out there](#other-validation-libraries). However none of them was really a good fit for `autoclass`, for diverse reasons:

 * only a few of them were available as decorators
 * many of them were strongly mixing type validation and value validation, which is not necessary anymore thanks to PEP484. This was making the `autoclass` examples more confusing.
 * only a few of them were providing a simple yet consistent and reusable framework to deal with validation functions, combine them, etc. And the good ones were based on defining a Schema first, which seemed a bit 'too much' for me already.
 * finally, none of them was really encouraging the community to collaborate by displaying a catalog of base validation functions per data type, open to contributions.

So I first created the `@validate` goodie in [autoclass](https://smarie.github.io/python-autoclass/). When the project became more mature, I decided to extract it and make it independent, so that maybe the community will find it interesting. 

When this project grew, I found that its [embedded library of base validation functions](./base_validation_lib) was not flexible enough to cover a large variety of use cases, and will probably **never** be even if we try our best, so I came up with the complementary [mini_lambda syntax](https://smarie.github.io/python-mini-lambda/) which is now an independent project, typically used when your base validation function is very specific, but yet quite simple to write in plain python.

 * We had this [discussion on python-ideas](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/python-ideas/ZSp9UKmnF2Q) to suggest a `validate` statement, functional equivalent of `assert_valid`, that would be built-in the python syntax so as to reduce parenthesis. An [issue](https://bugs.python.org/issue32590) was also created.
 * [decorator](http://decorator.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) library, which provides everything one needs to create complex decorators easily (signature and annotations-preserving decorators, decorators with class factory) as well as provides some useful decorators (`@contextmanager`, `@blocking`, `@dispatch_on`). We use it to preserve the signature of wrapped methods.
 * Julien Danjou's [Definitive Guide to Python Exceptions](https://julien.danjou.info/blog/2016/python-exceptions-guide). It was of great inspiration and help to design `valid8`'s exception hierarchy.
